# three-init

### React Three Fiber Template

Very simple template to get you started with React Three Fiber.

### Usage

based on Vite React Template so everything should work as usual:

`cd` into project root and run

```shell
pnpm i
```

Afterwards `dev`, `build` and `preview` should work as expected.
